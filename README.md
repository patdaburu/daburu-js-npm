# daburu-js-npm
This is a simple boiler-plate for an NPM module written in JavaScript.
In addition to the basics required to publish the module, it also
contains setup for unit testing with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/),
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/), and [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/).

After setting up your npm account and .nprmc file, run the following
npm scripts:

```bash
npm install
npm publish
```
